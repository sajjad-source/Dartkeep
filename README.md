# DartKeep

A real time based note taking app with a sleek UI/UX interface, allowing for easy note management and sharing.

## What Worked Well

- Planning what components I had and how they were going to interact with each other (props, states, etc.) worked out really well.
- This allowed for smooth implementation for a lot of the core functionality such as adding, deleting, editing, etc.
- Integration with real-time firebase storage was smooth due to the logic and code being well-written / organized.

## What Didn't

- Styling the UI/UX. Since it was my first time not using regular CSS, and working with a pre-built HTML structure, I had a bit of trouble visualizing what the HTML structure looks like from React.
- Using Tailwind was a learning experience, from reading their documentations, to figuring out how to install and configure certain plugins. However, I loved it! And can see why it is a go to.
- As I started expanding functionality and adding extra-credit, maintaing a lot of components/states, and passing props became a bit messy. It became harder and harder for me to try to scale this application.

## Extra Credit

- Implemented resizable and scrollable notes that update in real-time, enhancing user interaction and visual organization.
- Enhanced z-index management ensures that notes are appropriately layered when dragged or interacted with, with modals taking precedence during edits.
- Added a search functionality that allows filtering of notes based on their titles or content, providing a more efficient way to locate specific information.
- Organized notes in a grid layout which maintains a structured appearance regardless of note modifications, such as additions or deletions.
- Designed a user-friendly interface featuring a retractable sidebar with hover capabilities that display the name, improving navigation and aesthetic appeal.`
